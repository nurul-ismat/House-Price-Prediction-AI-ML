## 🏠 House Price Prediction
## Tech Stack: 
Python | Scikit-learn | XGBoost | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn

## Description:
This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on various property features. Built using the Kaggle 
The "House Prices – Advanced Regression Techniques" dataset uses regression models and data preprocessing techniques to achieve accurate price predictions.

## ✨ Key Features:
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Comparison of multiple regression models
- Gradient Boosting Regressor for final prediction (R² Score: 87.16%)
- Model serialization using Pickle (gbr.pkl)
- Submission-ready output (submission.csv)

## 📂 File Overview:
- house_price_prediction.ipynb → Main notebook with code and workflow
- submission.csv → Predicted house prices
- gbr.pkl → Trained Gradient Boosting model

## 📦 Libraries Used:
numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost

## 🎯 Objective:
To build an accurate and efficient regression model for predicting house prices using advanced ML techniques and feature analysis.
